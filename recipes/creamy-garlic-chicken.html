    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Calling all garlic lovers! This creamy garlic chicken is an easy, fragrant
      skillet dish that is great with mashed potatoes or mashed cauliflower.
      Since it cooks in one pan, cleanup is easy, too.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning, or seasoning blend of choice</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>
        8 garlic cloves, or more as needed, peeled and smashed, about 1/4 cup
        lightly packed
      </li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine herb seasoning, salt, pepper, granulated garlic, and flour in a
        1-gallon resealable plastic bag and mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine butter and olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium
        heat. Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels, place in the bag of
        seasoned flour, seal, and toss chicken thighs in the flour mixture until
        evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        When butter stops sizzling, add chicken pieces and cook until nicely
        browned, no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 4 to 5
        minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center
        should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove to a plate and keep
        warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add smashed garlic to the same skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        cook garlic, stirring frequently, just until fragrant, no longer than 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cream to the skillet, and stir up any browned bits in the bottom of
        the pan. Stir in chicken broth. Increase heat to medium, and bring the
        sauce to a boil, stirring occasionally. Cook until the sauce is reduced
        by half, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sample garlic cream sauce and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Return
        chicken to the skillet and stir in any accumulated juices. Allow chicken
        to heat through. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
